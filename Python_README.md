# Python README
- print(args): prints out the results of the arguments passed.
- type(args) : finds the data type of the argument passed.
- input(strings) : Used to engage with users in the frontend to retrieve data.
- variables =  : a storage of code that is mutable.

## Data types - strings, int, floats, BOOLEAN
Data types are the different ways objects in code can be identified and dictates how these objects can be used.

- strings : are charcters surrounded by quotes.
- integers : are whole numbers.
- floats : are decimal numbers.
- booleans : are binary true or false statements.

## casting - int(), float(), bool(), str()

Casting is a way to change the data type of a variable. Passing variables through the above functions will change the datatypes accordingly. IE int(var) makes var an int.
